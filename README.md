## Introduction

This repository, authored by Rajpal Nishad, serves as a compilation of my solutions to the Data Structures Lab programs during my second year of B.Tech. Each program is implemented in C language and aims to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in various data structures and algorithms.

## List of Programs

1. **Program to implement Stack using array in C.**
2. **Program to implement Stack using Linked List in C.**
3. **Program to implement Queue using array in C.**
4. **Program to implement Queue using Linked List in C.**
5. **Program to implement Circular Queue using Array in C.**
6. **program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion in C.**
7. **Program to implement Linear Search in C.**
8. **Program to implement Bubble Sort in C.**
9. **Program to implement Selection Sort in C.**
10. **Program to implement Quick Sort in C.**
11. **Program to implement Multiplication of 2D array in C.**
12. **Implementation of a circular queue using an array in C.**
13. **Program to implement Dequeue in C.**

## How to Use

To run a specific program, navigate to the corresponding program's folder (`DS_Lab_Programs/ProgramX/`). Follow these steps:

1. Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc program.c -o program`).
3. Run the compiled program (`./program`).

Note: Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC.
